# TinyReactPack

This is a very lightweight React boilerplate I can use when I just need a quick and simple development enviroment. I got tired of needing to use create-react-app and generate a 300MB folder when I just needed a bare minimum webpack server and react to throw together a tiny experiment or prototype. 

This boilerplate is ~50MB and should run out of the box after npm install and npm run dev. Feel free to use, customize, and do what you want if you are interested.This is a very rough around the edges boilerplate so you will probably want to modify this quite a bit.
